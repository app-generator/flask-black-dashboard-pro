- Clone the source code and build the [Flask Dashboard Black PRO](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/flask-dashboard-black-pro) using the instructions presented in this documentation.

<br />

## Prepare your environment

The product is built on top of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), a popular Python Web Framework. To build the app, Python3 should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account - the invitation to the source code, will be sent on your account.
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check Python (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2 # <--- All good
```

<br />

> Check GIT command tool (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check git
$ git --version
$ git version 2.10.1 # <--- All good
```

<br />

## Project Structure

The boilerplate code is built with a modular structure that follows the recommended pattern used by many open-source projects. The most important files and  directories are shown below:

<br />

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >                          # application root folder
    |
    |--- app/__init__.py                  # application constructor  
    |--- app/base/                        # base blueprint
    |--- app/base/static/assets           # Img, CSS, Janascript files
    |--- app/base/templates               # Jinja2 files (layouts, login pages)
    |                |---<errors>         # Dir - Error pages: 404, 500
    |                |---<login>          # Dir - Login and Registration pages
    |                |---<site_template>  # Dir - Components: footer, sidebar, header
    |
    |
    |--- app/home/                        # home blueprint
    |--- app/home/templates               # Jinja2 files (Pages): index, icons, tables
    |                |---- index.html     # Main dashboard page
    |                |---- maps.html      # Maps page
    |                |---- profile.html   # Profile Page
    |                |---- tables.html    # UI Tables
    |                |---- icons.html     # Ui Icons
    |
    |--- .env                             # store env variables
    |--- config.py                        # app configuration profiles: Debug, Production
    |
    |--- requirements.txt                 # Requirements for development - SQLite storage
    |--- requirements-pgsql.txt           # Requirements for production  - Pgsql Database
    |
    |--- run.py                           # bootstrap the app

$
$ # OR with PostgreSQL connector
$ # pip install -r requirements-pgsql.txt
$
$ # Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
$ (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ (Windows) set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ (Powershell) $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$
$ # Set up the DEBUG environment
$ # (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_ENV=development
$ # (Windows) set FLASK_ENV=development
$ # (Powershell) $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
$
$ # Start the application (development mode)
$ # --host=0.0.0.0 - expose the app on all network interfaces (default 127.0.0.1)
$ # --port=5000    - specify the app port (default 5000)  
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
$
$ # Access the dashboard in browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

<br />

## Deployment

<br />

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---

The application can be easily executed in a docker container. The steps:

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/priv-flask-dashboard-black-pro.git
$ cd priv-flask-dashboard-black-pro
```

> Start the app in Docker

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose build && sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using `gunicorn` binary

### What is [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

### [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)

<br />

### [Black Dashboard PRO](https://demos.creative-tim.com/marketplace/black-dashboard-pro/docs/1.0/getting-started/introduction)
